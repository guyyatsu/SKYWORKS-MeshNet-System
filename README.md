# SKYWORKS-MeshNet-System
This is basically my swan song as far as tech is concerned.


## The Goal
We're trying to come up with an excuse to put out
as many raspberry Pi's as we can in places that they have
access to the internet.

Ultimately, we're trying to collect as many namespaces
under our domain as possible.


## Reasons people would use our raspberry pi's
- personal website hosting.
  - Once we establish a personal connection with a business we could pitch them hosting for their own website and all they'd need to do is update their already existing DNS credentials.
  - Come up with a standardized template for a static website, and we could also implement an online payment system that we skim from ofc but also charge less than the competition.
- total VPN encompassment.
- if we can a direct line to the businesses router then we could offer them VPN access by virtue of being able to route network requests in Linux and having access to a range of IP to fall back on.
- a sense of civic duty to share freely available information.
  - we could sweeten the deal by providing every patron of the system with a free copy of the entirety of wikipedia, as well as literally any other resource available in the internet.
